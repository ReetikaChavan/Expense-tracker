# Expense Tracker

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the "Expense Tracker" project! In this project, we have developed a simple expense tracker application using Python and Tkinter GUI toolkit. The application allows users to add their expenses, view the expense distribution using a pie chart, and manage their financial records efficiently.

## Project Overview

- **Expense Management**: Users can add their expenses by entering the expense name and amount. The application validates the input and stores the expenses in a list.

- **Data Visualization**: The application provides a feature to generate a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of expenses based on their names and amounts.

## Features

- **Expense Addition**: Users can add expenses by providing the name and amount of the expense. The application ensures that only valid numeric amounts are accepted.

- **Pie Chart Generation**: Users can visualize their expenses using a pie chart, which displays the distribution of expenses based on their names and amounts.
